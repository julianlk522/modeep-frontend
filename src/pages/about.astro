			<h2>MODEEP: <span style="font-weight: normal;">MOdular filtration and Decentralized Evaluation of EPic internet treasure</span></h2>

			<p>
				<strong>Modeep</strong> marks the hiding places of treasured links found by brave web wanderers. It's purpose is to curate and organize great online things that engage our hearts and minds, so that you may easily discover and enjoy them.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Epic internet treasure" can be anything anyone cares about. Any topic, and importantly any<em>combination of topics</em>, is fair game and can be dynamically indexed.
			</p>

			<p>Recommendations are produced by an open user base and its consensus, to the extent that that's possible. There is an algorithm (well... a few), but it is minimal, <a href="https://github.com/julianlk522/modeep-backend">open source</a>, and deliberately <a href="/about/how#global-tag-calculation">transparent</a>. Links are evaluated by simple, predictable rules and aggregate feedback interactions like clicks, likes, and <a href="/about/how#cats">cat</a> assignments.</p>

			<h2>Benefits</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Objective, relevant recommendations.</strong> Link sorting and ranking are decided by cumulative user interactions and other simple metadata, not an opaque algorithm. Filtering to match various conditions is easy and reliable because searches do exactly what they say they do, nothing more, nothing less. Finding what most people recommend for something is very easy: by default, the most-liked links from any search go first.  Because fairness and accountability are crucial in this exchange, Modeep is <a href="https://github.com/julianlk522/modeep-backend">open</a> and made to be easily understood.</li>

				<li><strong>Maximal search precision.</strong> Matching <em>all</em>&mdash;not <em>any</em>&mdash; of your keywords (cats). In exchange for not getting an endless feed to scroll, you get sniper-like concentration on the few most truly noteworthy items for your inquiry. Incrementally adding or removing specificity by <a href="/about/how#stacking-cats">stacking</a> or un-stacking cats lets you fine-tune the breadth of your searches to be just right.</li>

				<li><strong>No distractions.</strong> Modeep is more like a library or art gallery than a bar&mdash;an efficient pipeline for accessing the documented world. No being inundated with obnoxious ads or other unsolicited fluff. You're encouraged to effortlessly locate specific material using specialized search tools, or to wander amid new ideas and see what looks interesting. Comments, direct messaging, and other fun but inappropriate attention-callers are absent in order to provide you with the focus to exclusively and thoroughly enjoy these purposefully curated online delights.</li>
